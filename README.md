# Personal Portfolio Website

A minimalist, accessible and responsive portfolio website built with Astro and TailwindCSS.

## 🙏 Credits

This portfolio is based on the [AstroZen template](https://github.com/immois/astro-zen) by [immois](https://github.com/immois). Thank you for creating this excellent foundation!

I've modified and extended the original template to better suit my portfolio needs, adding custom features and styling on top of the existing codebase.
